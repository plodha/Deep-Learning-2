Hints : https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/tree/master/tfx/examples (Links to an external site.)

Sample colab : https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/components_keras  or https://github.com/Building-ML-Pipelines/building-machine-learning-pipelines/blob/master/interactive-pipeline/interactive_pipeline.ipynb (Links to an external site.)

 

Extra credits :

a) Write tfx colabs for all of the above not just one

b) Write cloud ai platform pipelines for all of the above (not just one)

c) even more extra points - showcase in kubeflow, airflow, beam - all three (one each of above examples)

 

NOTE: DO NOT COPY PASTE - DO FROM SCRATCH BY TYPING. DOES NOT MATTER. This is for you to learn - not to just do it for marks. TFX is hard topic - the more you do it the more you will master.

 

 

Everything should be published in github with proper readme - with proper access control for me to grade. Please ensure all assets are there (run of the colab properly shown etc.,. and link to screenshots of cloud etc.,.)

 

Github URL should be provided in the homework
