In this assignment you will build a simple transformer with attention layer and do text classification of imdb

(hint - please see https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_classification_with_transformer/ (Links to an external site.))

 

Submit the proper colab with proper tensorboard visualization.

 

Everything should be published in github with proper readme - with proper access control for me to grade. Please ensure all assets are there (run of the colab properly shown)

 

Github URL should be provided in the homework. 

 

Do not copy and paste - use the reference code as an example and write your own - Note : this is for your learning and proficiency. 

Extra credit assignment 

 

a) Semantic similarity with pretrained BERT

Hint : https://keras.io/examples/nlp/semantic_similarity_with_bert/

Semantic Similarity is the task of determining how similar two sentences are, in terms of what they mean. This assignment demonstrates the use of SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) Corpus to predict sentence semantic similarity with Transformers. You will fine-tune a BERT model that takes two sentences as inputs and that outputs a similarity score for these two sentences.

b) Text classification with pretrained word embeddings (GLOve)

 

In this example, you will show how to train a text classification model that uses pre-trained word embeddings.

You will work with the Newsgroup20 dataset, a set of 20,000 message board messages belonging to 20 different topic categories.

For the pre-trained word embeddings, we'll use GloVe embeddings (Links to an external site.).
