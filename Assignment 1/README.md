NOTE: DO NOT COPY PASTE - DO FROM SCRATCH BY TYPING. YOU CAN PICK PYTORCH OR TENSORFLOW. DOES NOT MATTER.

 

Part 1 :

 

a) Pick an appropriate problem domain for multi instance learning for which a small  data set is readily available, Implement and submit a proper colab with proper ablation study (with various tunings) using tensorboard  for multi instance learning. Submit a nice readme explaining the problem you are trying to solve with multi instance learning, the approach. Make sure the colab is highly commented and readable with proper results confusion matrices, metrics, showing error examples the model not able to identify etc.,. - follow the template in https://github.com/fastai/fastbook (Links to an external site.) and https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/04_mnist_basics.ipynb (Links to an external site.) and https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/05_pet_breeds.ipynb (Links to an external site.) for the results. The results visualization is very important aspect of the overall problem.  Aim for state of art approach (extra points)  to solve this problem 

 

Note: pick reasonable training set and reasonable problem - not 100s of millions of instances.

Example acceptable code usecases : the colab in slides (medium article).  or https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/AttentionDeepMIL (Links to an external site.)

Everything should be published in github with proper readme - with proper access control for me to grade. Please ensure all assets are there (run of the colab properly shown)

 

Github URL should be provided in the homework. Create two seperate directories. Assignment_1
